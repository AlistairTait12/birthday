# **How to compare the difference between time objects?**
- Create a time object representing _now_
- Create a time object that represents the _next_ occurrence of the person's birthday
    - Is the next occurrence _this_ year or _next_ year?
    - Basically has their birthday already _happened_ this year?
        - if yes, add on one year
- Find the difference between the objects in days...
